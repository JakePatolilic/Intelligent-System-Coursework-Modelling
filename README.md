# Maze Solver Using Depth-First Search

## Overview
This repository is a Maze solver developed using C#. The system is only limited to a 10 x 10 matrix, 
where obstacles are randomly generated. It is tested with different scenarious whether the model will
be able to find the exit, and checks if there is no path towards the exit.
